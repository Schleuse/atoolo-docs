The strategy for deploying Atoolo projects in the IES context is described below.</p> <p>The strategy is designed so that files no longer need to be loaded from a Git or Composer repository for deployment. The deployment is carried out by providing the project with all dependencies in a <code>tar.gz</code> archive. This archive is unpacked on the target server into a directory specifically created for this archive. E.G.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject-1.0.0\n</code></pre> <p>This deployment bundle provides a 'deploy' command that is now executed in the project.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject-1.0.0/bin/console deployment:deploy\n</code></pre> <p>Execute the command for the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>a Platform Check is performed to ensure that the required PHP version and the required PHP extensions are installed.</li> <li>create the Symfony caches for e.g. containers, routing, etc.</li> <li>execute bundle- and project-specific deployment task</li> </ol> <p>The project may only be activated once all steps have been successfully completed. This is done by setting a symlink to the directory that the web server uses for the relevant host.</p> <pre><code>/apps/myproject -&gt; /apps/myproject-1.0.0/\n</code></pre> <p>This enables a smooth update to a new version. It is also possible to roll back to a previous version.</p> <p>By using a symlink, however, there are a few things to consider for the PHP project.</p> <ul> <li>In the standard configuration, opcache does not recognize when the real path to a PHP file changes. However, this is the case if the symlink points to a new version. The option   <pre><code>opcache.revalidate_path = 1\n</code></pre>   can change this behavior. This means that the opcache checks whether the real path has changed with every request. This can be done in the web server configuration. For Apache, for example, in the VirtualHost configuration.   <pre><code>SetEnv PHP_VALUE \"opcache.revalidate_path = 1\"\n</code></pre>   This means that the configuration is retained even after a PHP minor update if the system creates a new configuration directory for the PHP version.</li> <li>The configuration of the web server must also be adapted. The web server must be configured so that it follows the symlink. In Apache, for example, this can be achieved with the <code>FollowSymLinks</code> option.</li> <li>When using the Symfony message bus, there are workers that wait for the messages. These workers must be restarted after a deployment.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"develop/bundles/deployment/#deployment-task","title":"Deployment-Task","text":"<p>You can implement your own deployment task.

This can be achieved by customizing query parameters, such as adding boosting factors to specific fields or applying custom functions. In this way, search results can be specifically influenced to place more relevant results at the top.</p> <p>The following parameters can be used to influence the result:</p> Name Description <code>queryFields</code> This parameter specifies the fields to be searched and their relative importance. It is a list of fields, optionally with boost factors that indicate how heavily each field should be weighted when matching search terms. For example, qf=title^2.0 description means that the title field is twice as important as the description field. <code>phraseFields</code> This parameter increases the importance of whole phrases (word sequences) in the specified fields. It is used to increase the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as phrases in these fields. For example, pf=title^1.5 content increases the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as a phrase in the title field more than in the content field. <code>boostQueries</code> This parameter allows additional query clauses that increase the relevance score of documents that match these clauses. These clauses do not affect whether a document matches the main query, but increase the score of documents that match them. For example, <code>contenttype:(text/html*)^10</code> would increase the relevance score of HTML documentserh\u00f6hen. <code>boostFunctions</code> This parameter applies function-based boosts to the relevance score. These are mathematical functions that adjust the score based on field values or other criteria. For example, <code>if(termfreq(sp_objecttype,'news'),scale(sp_date,0,12),scale(sp_date,10,11)</code> could be used to score older news articles less highly <code>tie</code> (Tie-Breaker-Multiplikator) This parameter combine the best match points from multiple fields. The tie parameter adjusts how much lower scores affect the overall score. A higher tie value means that the lower scores have more influence on the final score. For example, tie=0.1 could be used to give the secondary fields some influence in the scoring process, preventing only the best matches from dominating. <p>Setting the boosting parameters requires in-depth knowledge of how the search index works and its schema.

In this way, search results can be specifically influenced to place more relevant results at the top.</p> <p>The following parameters can be used to influence the result:</p> Name Description <code>queryFields</code> This parameter specifies the fields to be searched and their relative importance. It is a list of fields, optionally with boost factors that indicate how heavily each field should be weighted when matching search terms. For example, qf=title^2.0 description means that the title field is twice as important as the description field. <code>phraseFields</code> This parameter increases the importance of whole phrases (word sequences) in the specified fields. It is used to increase the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as phrases in these fields. For example, pf=title^1.5 content increases the relevance of documents in which the search terms appear as a phrase in the title field more than in the content field. <code>boostQueries</code> This parameter allows additional query clauses that increase the relevance score of documents that match these clauses. These clauses do not affect whether a document matches the main query, but increase the score of documents that match them. For example, <code>contenttype:(text/html*)^10</code> would increase the relevance score of HTML documentserh\u00f6hen. <code>boostFunctions</code> This parameter applies function-based boosts to the relevance score. These are mathematical functions that adjust the score based on field values or other criteria. For example, <code>if(termfreq(sp_objecttype,'news'),scale(sp_date,0,12),scale(sp_date,10,11)</code> could be used to score older news articles less highly <code>tie</code> (Tie-Breaker-Multiplikator) This parameter combine the best match points from multiple fields. The tie parameter adjusts how much lower scores affect the overall score. A higher tie value means that the lower scores have more influence on the final score. For example, tie=0.1 could be used to give the secondary fields some influence in the scoring process, preventing only the best matches from dominating. <p>Setting the boosting parameters requires in-depth knowledge of how the search index works and its schema.

It works by dividing search results into different categories or facets that are representative features or attributes of the information found.</p> <p>The facet type is required to define a facet. This can be, for example, the object type and the possible values of the facet type whose results are to be returned.</p> <p>This can look like this, for example:</p> <pre><code>facets: [\n  {\n    key: \"articletypes\",\n    objectTypes: [\"content\", \"news\"]\n  }\n]\n</code></pre> <p>The specification of a <code>key</code> is necessary so that the facet can be identified in the result, as it is possible to specify several facets.</p> <p>A facet is defined here via the object type. The possible values <code>content</code> and <code>news</code> indicate that the number of possible hits is returned for these two values.</p> <p>With <code>facetGroups</code> in <code>SearchResult</code> the results of the facets can be output.</p> <pre><code>facetGroups {\n  key\n  facets {\n    key\n    hits\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A result could look like this, for example:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"facetGroups\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"articletypes\",\n      \"facets\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"content\",\n          \"hits\": 664\n        },\n        {\n          \"key\": \"news\",\n          \"hits\": 1633\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This indicates that a search filtered by <code>objectTypes:content</code> would return <code>664</code> hits. A search with the filter on <code>objectTypes:news</code> would return <code>1633</code> hits.</p> <p>The facets are determined on the basis of the search. One problem with this is that if, for example, the filter <code>objectTypes:content</code> is used, the search result no longer contains any hits of the type <code>news</code> and therefore the result of the facet for <code>news</code> is <code>0</code>.</p> <p>To solve this problem, you can specify for each facet which filter should not be taken into account so that the result is not distorted.</p> <p>This is done via the <code>excludeFilter</code> parameter. This parameter refers to the <code>key</code> of a filter. This can look like this, for example.</p> <pre><code>search(\n  input: {\n    filter: [{ key: \"articletypefilter\", objectTypes: [\"content\"] }]\n    facets: [\n      {\n        key: \"articletypes\",\n        objectTypes: [\"content\", \"news\"],\n        excludeFilter: [\"articletypefilter\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>excludeFilter: [\"articletypefilter\"]</code> is used to refer to the filter <code>key: \"articletypefilter\"</code>. When determining this facet, the filter <code>articletypefilter</code> is no longer taken into account. This means that the values of the facet can be taken into account correctly, even though the filter is used for the search.</p> <p>A complete GraphQL Query could then look like this:</p> <pre><code>query {\n  search(\n    input: {\n      filter: [{ key: \"articletypefilter\", objectTypes: [\"content\"] }]\n      facets: [\n        {\n          key: \"articletypes\"\n          objectTypes: [\"content\", \"news\"]\n          excludeFilter: [\"articletypefilter\"]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ) {\n    total\n    offset\n    queryTime\n    results {\n      id\n    }\n    facetGroups {\n      key\n      facets {\n        key\n        hits\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Any number of facets can be specified.
